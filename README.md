# my_own_secretary
I'd like to make my own secretary like jarvis in Iron man.
I'll use Raspberry pi as a server. and I and my secretary communicate through web platform and android.

So, There are technologies(api) that I'm gonna use
<ul>
  <li>web_speech_api</li>
  <li>python deeplearning(To calculate words to say properly)</li>
  <li>OpenCV(To recognize me through a camera)</li>
  <li>Crawling(To learn by herself)</li>
  <li>weather or something...</li>
</ul>

As a result, I'm gonna use these languages

<ul>
  <li>HTML and CSS and Javascript</li>
  <li>PHP(To view a UI)</li>
  <li>Python(To calculate and use simple library)</li>
</ul>
